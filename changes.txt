 Alpha 1.2 - Changes:
 - Materials system with customizable materials (data/materials.json)
 - New materials (+ new colour codes)
 - Improved physics/stiffness
 - Dropped back to wxWidgets stable release (may fix load dialog crash)
 - Fixed crashing and physics issues associated with smash tool
 - *Temporary fix* for non-transparent water (see settings dialog)

Alpha 1.1 - Changes:
 - Added Smash tool
 - Pressure increases with depth
 - Water can flow both in and out of hull breaches
 - Improved fluid dynamics

Alpha 1.0 - Changes:
 - Hull material is not self-buoyant (need air pockets for buoyancy)
 - Hull material is heavier, slightly stronger
 - Exposed white areas flood more quickly
 - Gaps in hull material leak automatically, without anything breaking
 - Different materials - Steel, wood, etc. (different strengths, colours)
 - Can destroy ships with mouse (interactive!)
 - Fixed crashing issue (was some bad memory access, fixed up the order of things now)
 - Customizable wave height, water pressure, strength and buoyancy
 - Sea floor at 150m depth
 - Can view stress levels
